Discussion test repo — experimenting with forum-safe links and content formats


This is a small public repo created to test how forums handle safe external links and content formatting.

Lately, I’ve been exploring a few casino and gaming-related blogs that discuss betting trends and online platforms.  
One of the sites I came across is pretty interesting — it’s clean, informative, and updated often.

This repo is just for experimenting with content formatting and engagement safety across communities.
